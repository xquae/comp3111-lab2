# Lab2 :Learning and practicing Interface and Inheritance in Java
## Inheritance
In Java, it is possible to inherit attributes and methods from one class to
another. We group the "inheritance concept" into two categories:\
• Subclass (child): the class that inherits from another class\
• Superclass (parent): the class being inherited from\
To inherit from a class, use the extends 
## Interface
• Achieve security: Hide certain details and only show the important ones
of an object (interface).\
• Support “multiple inheritance”: It can be achieved with interfaces, as the
class can implement multiple interfaces but cannot extend multiple ones.
